## About 
In this repository you can see my first project and basic applications about **onion architecture** and **asp.net**. I uploaded this picture because it helped me to understand layers on architecture so I loaded it for also people who look at this repository and implement it for their own works.  

## Usage 
You can use it as a document for practising **C#** and for understand basics of **onion architecture**. I also created multiple models like devices, movies, market and products. Above this models I added other layers to project file. 

## Key Features
- API
- Folder Structure
- Services and Back-End Side
